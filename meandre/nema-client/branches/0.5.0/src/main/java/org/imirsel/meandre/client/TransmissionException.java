 * An exception that is thrown when there is a problem communicating with
 * a Meandre Infrastructure server through it's webservices. This is the
 * default exception the Meandre*Client classes use when they have a problem
 * accessing the server they're talking to.
 *
 * The typical scenarios this is used for are:
 * 1) server doesn't respond
 * 2) client doesn't undertand the response it gets back from a server
