November 18th 2009 -Amit Kumar for NEMA project

This project contains aspects that are used to sanitize the third party libraries to remove
System.exit command particularily. 

The aspects are used in conjunction with the ajc compiler 

<http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/downloads.php>


The ajc compiler allows to weave a binary jar file and it outputs a jar file with byte code modified with the
aspects defined.


In order to sanitize jAudio jar following command was used

./ajc -injars jAudio-mod.jar -outjar jAudio-sanitized.jar 
-sourceroots src/main/java/org/imirsel/aspects -showWeaveInfo -verbose

where jAudio-mod.jar is the jar file without the crude such as build/* the installer files etc.

The sanitized jar file is jAudio-sanitized.jar.
