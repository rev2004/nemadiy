#summary Documents how to setup an Eclipse development environment to work on the NEMA code base.

= Introduction =

In addition to the base Eclipse environment, a number of third-party plugins are required to properly configure an Eclipse environment for the NEMA code base. This document will help you through the complete process of installation.


= Details =

The NEMA Eclipse environment requires the following Eclipse plugins:
  * Spring IDE
  * M2 Eclipse
  * Subversion SVN connector
  * Google code connector for Mylyn
  * Find Bugs

One way to configure your Eclipse environment is to download the "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers" from the Eclipse site (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), and then download and install each plugin individually. However, this can be a time consuming and error prone process.

Instead, we recommend you download and install the Spring Source Tool Suite, a Spring branded Eclipse environment that comes pre-installed with Spring IDE and M2 Eclipse.
