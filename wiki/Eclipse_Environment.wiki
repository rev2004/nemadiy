#summary Documents how to setup an Eclipse development environment to work on the NEMA code base.

= Introduction =

In addition to the base Eclipse environment, a number of third-party plugins are required to properly configure an Eclipse environment for the NEMA code base. This document will help you through the complete process of installation.


= Details =

The NEMA Eclipse environment requires the following Eclipse plugins:
  * Spring IDE
  * M2 Eclipse
  * Subversion SVN connector
  * Google code connector for Mylyn
  * Find Bugs

Ordinarily, one would download the Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers from the Eclipse site (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), and then download and install each plugin individually. This can be a time consuming and error prone process. 

Eclipse version: 3.4.2 or greater
Required plugins:
  * Spring IDE (http://dist.springframework.org/release/IDE)
  * M2Eclipse (http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/update/)
  * FindBugs (http://findbugs.cs.umd.edu/eclipse)
