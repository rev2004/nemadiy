#summary Documents how to setup an Eclipse development environment to work on the NEMA code base.

= Introduction =

In addition to the base Eclipse environment, a number of third-party plugins are required to properly configure an Eclipse environment for the NEMA code base. This document will help you through the complete process of installation.


= Details =

The NEMA Eclipse environment requires the following Eclipse plugins:
  * Spring IDE
  * M2 Eclipse
  * Subversive SVN connector
  * Mylyn
  * Google code connector for Mylyn
  * Find Bugs

One way to configure your Eclipse environment is to download the "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers" from the Eclipse site (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), and then download and install each plugin individually. However, this can be a time consuming and error prone process.

Instead, we recommend you download and install the Spring Source Tool Suite, a Spring branded Eclipse environment that comes pre-installed with Spring IDE, Mylyn, and M2 Eclipse. Then, you can install the remaining plugins.

Here are the complete steps for setting up your Eclipse environment.

  # Download and install the Spring Source Tool Suite (http://www.springsource.com/products/eclipse-downloads)
  # Now install the SVN plugin, Subversive. Open the Spring Source Tool Suite, and go to Help->Install New Software
  # In the "Work with:" field, type "http://download.eclipse.org/releases/galileo/"
  # Click the "Add..." button, a dialog box will appear. In the "Name" field, type something like, "Subversive Update Site" then click "OK".
  # In the categorized list of plugins that appears, expand the "Collaboration" tree node and select the "Subversive SVN Integration for the Mylyn Project" and the "Subversive SVN Team Provider" plugins. Complete the installation by following the buttons.
  # To complete the Subversive installation, you will need to restart Eclipse. When Eclipse restarts, Subversive will ask you to choose an SVN connector to install. Choose SVNKit 1.3.0.
  # Now install the Google Code Mylyn Connector. Open the Spring Source Tool Suite, and go to Help->Install New Software
  # In the "Work with:" field, type "http://knittig.de/googlecode-mylyn-connector/update/"
  # Click the "Add..." button, a dialog box will appear. In the "Name" field, type something like, "Google Code Mylyn Connector" then click "OK".
  # In the list of plugins that appears, expand the "Nightly Builds" tree node and select the "Google Code Mylyn Connector Feature" plugin. Complete the installation by following the buttons.
