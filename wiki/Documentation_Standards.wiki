#summary Documents the standards and conventions for code comments.

= Introduction =

Good comments are essential to easily readable and maintainable code. Good comments actually extend the life of code because well-commented code is more likely to be reused rather than rewritten. For open source projects, well-documented code communicates to casual observers and potential contributors that the project is committed to producing mature, quality code.

It is critical that documentation be written at the time of development when details are still fresh in your mind, rather than six months later as an afterthought. Likewise, when code is modified and/or extended, the comments and other documentation about the code should be immediately updated to reflect the changes.

Code comments fall into two categories:

    * Javadoc comments, which become part of the auto-generated documentation.
      * Provides an overview of the whole project (overview.html)
      * Explains the purpose of packages (package-info.java)
      * Explains the interface contract of classes (in each class file)
    * Code comments, which are available only by looking at the source code.
      * Explains how the code works

*All Javadoc and code comments should be complete thoughts, capitalized at the beginning and with a period at the end. Spelling and grammar should be correct.*

= Javadoc =

Javadoc is a program distributed with Java that generates HTML documentation files from Java source code files. Javadoc comments begin with /** and end with */. The comment immediately preceding a code construct (method, member, or class) documents that code construct. Javadoc documentation should be provided for all projects, packages, classes, interfaces, enums and all public, protected, and private members and methods contained therein.

Please take the time to familiarize yourself with the finer points of Javadoc at this URL: http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/javadoc/index.html
	When writing Javadoc comments, pay special attention to the first sentence of each Javadoc comment. This first sentence is used as a summary in the Javadocs. It is extremely helpful if the first sentence is a cogent and complete summary.

Javadoc comments can include embedded HTML formatting. Please use HTML comments sparingly, and make sure the markup is well-formed. Any code included in comments should be wrapped in code tags: <code>i = 1</code>.

The Javadoc program gives extensive diagnostics when run on a source file. Comments should be formatted until there are no Javadoc warnings.
