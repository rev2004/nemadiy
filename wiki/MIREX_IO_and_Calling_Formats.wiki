= Multiple-F0 Estimation and Tracking =

== Submission Format ==

Submissions have to conform to the specified format below:

 ''doMultiF0 "path/to/file.wav"  "path/to/output/file.F0" ''

path/to/file.wav: Path to the input audio file.

path/to/output/file.F0: The output file. 

== Output Format ==
For each sub task, the format of the output file is going to be different:
For the first task, F0-estimation on frame basis,  the output will be a file where each row has a  time stamp and a number of active F0s in that frame, separated by a tab for every 10ms increments. 
	
Example :
 ''time	F01	F02	F03	''

 ''time	F01	F02	F03	F04''

 ''time	...	...	...	...''

which might look like:

 ''0.78	146.83	220.00	349.23''

 ''0.79	349.23	146.83	369.99	220.00	''

 ''0.80	...	...	...	...''

For the second subtask,  for each row, the file should contain  the onset, offset and the F0 of each note event separated by a tab, ordered in terms of onset times:

 onset	offset F01

 onset	offset F02

 ...	... ...

which might look like:

 0.68	1.20	349.23

 0.72	1.02	220.00

 ...	...	...
