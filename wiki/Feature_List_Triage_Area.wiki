#summary List of current Issues for Triage

  * Run Meandre nodes on cluster.
  * Race condition with the flow service.
  * Memory issue with the Meandre nodes.
  * Memory lost when flow is canceled.
  * Move the services provided by the FlowMetadataServiceImpl and ComponentMetadataServiceImpl to the flow service
  * External binary code integration, upload user's own binary code

Andy/Mert and Kris to make a list of all the external integration code and there dependencies. Let's classify them and ask Dan to create Vitual machines with those dependencies in them. See if we can have a few kinds of VM image or if all the dependencies can be satisfied in one VM image.
    
We need to write an XML RPC based component head and tail that would work on these vm's
so that the component can be execute there.
    
A service needs to be created to support external integration module, this service will expose endpoints (input,output,streams) to the external integration.
    
We need to write some parser code to parse the results from the external integration modules to populate the data model for the result.
    

  * Extend the Flow Model to store component property lists based on repository.
For example in a Phase Vocoder flow we only want to show datasets 1,2 and 3 not all
of the datasets available
  * Create an interface to support the flow specific properties, addition of property values/removal etc.


  * Result Model needs to be created and parsers that would take output from the external user submitted
code and add the result to the database need to be written.
