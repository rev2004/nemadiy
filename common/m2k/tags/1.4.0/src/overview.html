M2K represents the music-specific set of D2K modules designed to
create a Virtual Research Lab (VRL) for MIR/MDL development,
prototyping and evaluation. M2K provides the framework for the MIREX
(Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange) contest, an annual
MIR evaluation.
<p>
The IMIRSEL (International Music Information Retrieval Systems
Evaluation Laboratory) project provides an unprecedented platform for
evaluating Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and Music Digital Library
(MDL) techniques, by bringing together large corpora and significant
computational resources with the necessary rights management and
technical infrastructure to support a variety of MIR/MDL research
areas. The standardized research collection being deployed represents
a large and diverse corpus of musical examples, which we are hosting
in our secure environment for use in evaluating MIR/MDL algorithms.
Grid services and National Center for Supercomputing Application's
(NCSA) D2K (Data-to-Knowledge) machine learning environment provide a
powerful, high performance, and secure framework for designing,
optimising, and executing complex MIR/MDL evaluation applications.
IMIRSEL provides a community resource for researchers who would
otherwise not be able to afford the content rights and computational
resources to carry out large-scale MIR/MDL evaluations. J. Stephen
Downie, Assistant Professor at the Graduate School of Library and
Information Science (GSLIS), University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), is director of IMIRSEL and is the project
principal investigator (PI).

M2K (Music-to-Knowledge) is a key element of  the IMIRSEL project. M2K
represents the music-specific set of D2K modules designed to create a
Virtual Research Lab (VRL) for MIR/MDL development, prototyping and
evaluation. The VRLs will be used by MIR/MDL researchers so they can
participate in future MIREX (Music Information Retrieval Evaluation
eXchange) contests.
<p>
D2K, together with a subsidary set of modules called, T2K
(Text-to-Knowledge), provide the basic foundation upon which M2K is
being developed. D2K/T2K are the result of a ongoing research and
development project of the Automated Learning Group (ALG) at NCSA. ALG
is headed by Prof. Michael Welge who is also an IMIRSEL project co-PI.
