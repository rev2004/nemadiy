org.imirsel.m2k.util to do list:

Create a walkthrough HTML file for whole package
	Short segment for each tool, just doing for this package would make M2K much more usable

Note: Moved test/train split modules to modelling package

ExternalIntegrationModules - convert to class and module harness -half done

Signal.java - Update metadataStandards() method, ouput String[]?
        Duplicate column names over data cols and update reader to support both old and new file formats
	
Update io.musicDB.RemapMusicDBFilenames.java to recurse into subdirs and 
		to compare paths not just filenames.

Add a purely similarity matrix based retrieval modules
Add a file reader for Similarity matrices based on DelimTextFileUtilites


---------------------------------
Long term wishlist:

Signal.java - 
        Get full review
	Add Xml-based file format?
	noMetadataException.java - could this be a sub-class of Signal??? would save importing it all the time

MatlabExternalIntegrationModules - Rebuild based on Matlink! Seems quite easy

Build MFCCExtractor, SpectralContrastExtractor, PsychoaccousticExtractor modules for util.featureExtractors package

Add better upSample and downSample modules with decimation/interpolation 

add custom prop panel with menu to select from known relevant metadata types or to set a custom one	
	Check CopyMetadataFromSignal.java and CopyMetadataFromSignalArray.java
	TranscriptionMapper.java
	AppendArrayToSignal.java, AppendMatrixStreamToSignal.java and AppendMatrixToSignal.java
	StripMetadataFromSignal.java and StripMetadataFromSignalArray.java
	AddIntMetadataToSignal.java
