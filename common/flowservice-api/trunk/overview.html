<title>NEMA Flow Service API Overview</title>

<body>
<p>Interfaces and classes that define the NEMA Flow Service API.</p>

<p>Author: Andrew Shirk (<a href="mailto:shirk@illinois.edu">shirk@illinois.edu</a>)</p>

<h1>Purpose</h1>

<p>
NEMA uses the Meandre framework to implement and execute workflow processes.
Meandre, however, lacks load balancing, job scheduling, and robust job 
monitoring services. The NEMA Flow Service implements these features as an 
abstraction layer that runs, as a Java RMI service, in front of a collection
of Meandre servers.
</p>

<p>
The NEMA Flow Service also has operations for returning descriptions of the 
Meandre flow templates, components and properties that are installed on the
Meandre servers. This removes the need for clients to have direct access to
the Meandre cluster.
</p>

<p>The API project is small, containing only the model classes and the service
interface itself.</p>
