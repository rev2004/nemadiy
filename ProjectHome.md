# Networked Environment for Music Analysis #

The NEMA framework project is a multinational, multidisciplinary cyberinfrastructure project for music information processing that builds upon and extends the music information retrieval research being conducted by the International Music Information Retrieval Systems Evaluation Laboratory (IMIRSEL) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).


Related applications for NEMA are also being developed at http://code.google.com/p/nema-apps/.

## Description ##
NEMA brings together the collective projects and the associated tools of six world leaders in the domains of music information retrieval (MIR), computational musicology (CM) and e-humanities research. The NEMA team aims to create an open and extensible webservice-based resource framework that facilitates the integration of music data and analytic/evaluative tools that can be used by the global MIR and CM research and education communities on a basis independent of time or location. To help achieve this goal, the NEMA team will be working co-operatively with the UIUC-based, Mellon-funded, Software Environment for the Advancement of Scholarly Research (SEASR) project to exploit SEASRâ€™s expertise and technologies in the domains of data mining and webservice-based resource framework development.
