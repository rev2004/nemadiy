<p>Interfaces and classes that implement the NEMA Flow Service API.</p>

<p>Author: Andrew Shirk (<a href="mailto:shirk@illinois.edu">shirk@illinois.edu</a>)</p>

<h1>Purpose</h1>

<p>
NEMA uses the Meandre framework to implement and execute workflow processes.
Meandre, however, lacks load balancing, job scheduling, and robust job 
monitoring services. The NEMA Flow Service implements these features as an 
abstraction layer that runs as a Java RMI service in front of a collection
of Meandre servers.
</p>

<h1>Job Scheduler</h1>

<p>Implementations of <code>org.imirsel.nema.flowservice.JobScheduler</code>
must be configured with a list of <code>MeandreServerProxyConfig</code>
instances. This is currently done via Spring dependency injection. These proxy 
configurations are used to create a set of worker
servers to process job requests. Each proxy configuration is used by the job 
scheduler to instantiate a new <code>MeandreServerProxy</code>, which it adds
to the worker pool. <code>MeandreServerProxy</code> should not be directly
instantiated. Rather, the factory method of 
<code>org.imirsel.nema.flowservice.MeandreServerProxyFactory</code>
should be used. For each Meandre server, there should be only one corresponding
<code>MeandreServerProxy</code> instance. As a result, 
<code>MeandreServerProxyFactory</code> manages a cache of proxy instances, 
and may return an existing instance.</p>

<p>A call to <code>FlowSerivce.executeJob()</code> causes the flow service
to create a new <code>Job</code> instance containing the details provided to the
method arguments. After the job instance is populated, it is persisted to
the database and the job is sent to the job scheduler. At the time of this
writing there is only one <code>JobScheduler</code> implementation 
(<code>org.imirsel.nema.flowservice.MeandreJobScheduler</code>) 
which simply places new jobs onto a queue. New implementations may provide more
sophisticated queuing algorithms.</p>

<p>After the <code>JobScheduler</code> has queued the job, control is
immediately returned to the client. This ensures that starting a job is a
non-blocking operation.</p>

<p>The <code>MeandreJobScheduler</code> manages two scheduled future tasks that
run periodically: one for running queued jobs, and the other (discussed later) 
for cleaning up after configuration changes. When the job runner task starts up,
it looks for a job at the head of the queue. If a job exists, it requests
the next available server from the load balancer. If the load balancer returns
a server proxy instance, the job scheduler tries to run the job on that server.
If an exception is thrown while attempting to start the job, the job is kept 
in the queue and the attempt is made again the next time the runner thread
starts up. After five failed tries, the job is marked as failed and is removed
from the queue.</p>

<p>The job runner task occasionally persists the state of the job to the
database. When doing so, managed transactions are used. This is because Spring
AOP transactions do not work in executor threads.</p>

<p>Calling <code>JobScheduler.setWorkerConfigs()</code> triggers an update
to the worker pool configuration. The job scheduler looks at the set of
configurations it has been provided and determines which servers have been
added, which have been removed, which are changed, and which are unchanged. 
It then modifies the pool to match the new configuration. If a server that 
has been removed from the worker configuration is still running jobs, the 
server is marked for removal and no further jobs are delegated to it.
Periodically, a task runs (mentioned earlier) that looks for servers marked
for removal. If a server marked for removal is no longer running jobs, it
is removed all together, and the server is decommissioned. This is achieved
by calling the <code>release()</code> method on the 
<code>MeandreServerProxyFactory</code>, which removes the proxy from the
cache.</p>

<h1>Load Balancers</h1>

<p>Injected into the <code>MeandreJobScheduler</code> is a
<code>MeandreLoadBalancer</code> instance. The load balancer is responsible
for providing the next available server among the servers in the worker pool.
There are currently two implementations: <code>RoundRobinLoadBalancer</code>
and <code>LeastUsedLoadBalancer</code>.</p>

<p><code>RoundRobinLoadBalancer</code>
maintains a circular linked list of server proxies, and a pointer to the
last returned server. Each time a server request is made, the load balancer
advances the pointer by one. If the server is not busy, it returns the server.
If the server is busy, the load balancer moves on to the next server. If all
servers are busy, it returns null.</p>

<p><code>LeastUsedLoadBalancer</code> is more effective at balancing the load
than <code>RoundRobinLoadBalancer</code>
because it determines which server to return based on how much
work the server is currently doing. Servers with the least load get returned
first.</p>

<h1>Job Monitoring</h1>

<p>Job monitoring is implemented in a loosely coupled fashion from the Meandre
server. Communication between a <code>MeandreServerProxy</code> and a 
Meandre server is done via a RESTful web service interface, and thus persistent
socket connections cannot be used to directly monitor jobs running on the
server. Instead, each NEMA flow is run with an accompanying Meandre Probe.</p>

<p>Probes are a facility provided by the Meandre API that can be used to
listen for the various lifecycle events of a Meandre flow. The Probe gets
notified when the various events occur. The Probe that was implemented for NEMA
simply receives the event notifications, and then writes that execution status
of the flow to the flow service's database.</p>

<p>To detect status updates of executing jobs, the flow service periodically
polls the database and compares the new status values with the cached
values from the previous query. When a difference is found, that status has
been updated by the NEMA Probe.</p>

<p>In the <code>org.imirsel.nema.flowservice.monitor</code> package is the
flow service's job monitor interface, <code>JobStatusMonitor</code>. The
<code>start</code> method is used by clients to begin monitoring a particular
job.</p>

<p>For example, after a job has been issued to the
<code>MeandreJobScheduler, </code>the <code>NemaFlowService</code> registers an
instance of <code>JobStatusNotificationCreator</code> (which implements 
<code>JobStatusUpdateListener</code>) with the job monitor in order to
notify users when their job status changes. When the notification creator is
called, it creates a new <code>Notification</code> object and persists it to
the database.</p>

<p>There is currently one <code>JobStatusMonitor</code> instance: 
<code>PollingJotStatusMonitor</code>. As mentioned earlier, this status monitor
polls the database for status changes for the jobs it is monitoring. Polling
is performed periodically in a scheduled future task.</p>

<h1>Configuration</h1>

<p>The NEMA Flow Service is configured using the
<code>flowservice.properties</code> file. The flow service monitors this file
at runtime and automatically deploys any changes. There are a number of rules
to be aware of when configuring the flow service:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The configuration file must be resolvable
to an absolute file system path.</li>
<li>All properties must be specified.</li>
<li>Multiple worker servers may be configured using comma separated values for each property. For example, multiple hosts would be configured using the following syntax:<ul><li>workerserver.hosts=worker1.foo.com,worker2.foo.com,worker3.foo.com</li></ul></li>
<li>Properties related to a certain server must occur at the same index for each property.</li>
<li>At least one worker server must be configured.</li>
<li>Worker servers cannot be simultaneously moved from the worker pool and made a head server. Remove the worker first and then make it the head in a subsequent configuration update..</li>
<li>A head server cannot be simultaneously removed from the head and placed in the worker pool. Remove the head server first and then make it a worker in a subsequent configuration update.</li>
<li>A head server cannot also be configured as a worker.</li>
<li>Multiple instances of the same worker are not allowed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The interface
<code>org.imirsel.nema.flowservice.config.FlowServiceConfig</code> provides
operations for accessing the specifics of the configuration at
any given time, and for registering observers to be notified of changes to 
the configuration. At the time of this writing, two implementations are 
provided. One is primarily for testing 
(<code>SimpleFlowServiceConfig</code>) and the other is for production
applications (<code>PropertiesBasedFlowServiceConfig</code>).</p>
<p>By implementing <code>FileChangeListener</code>, the
<code>PropertiesBasedFlowServiceConfig</code> is able to respond to changes made
directly to the configuration file. When it is instantiated,
<code>PropertiesBasedFlowServiceConfig</code> creates a new
<code>FileMonitor</code> instance, then registers itself as a listener. When
changes are made to the configuration file,
<code>PropertiesBasedFlowServiceConfig</code> reloads the file and determines
the current configuration. After the configuration has been read,
<code>PropertiesBasedFlowServiceConfig</code> notifies all listeners that the
configuration has changed.
<p>At the time of this writing, only <code>NemaFlowServiceConfig</code>
listens for changes to the configuration file. When changes are detected,
the flow service updates the head server, if it has changed, then supplies
the new worker configurations to the job scheduler.</p>
