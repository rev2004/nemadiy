Release Notes for ${project.version}



Release Notes for 0.5.0

	
	The 0.5.0 release works with the flowservice to schedule the flows. It uses the repository api to display the dataset/collection
	names and properties for flow components that use them. This release also uses a custom JSP tag library to render the components
	of a flow. All the components of a flow are displayed on one page -this would be improved in a future.
